# Gems

Gems Mod in a way is my attempt at making things harder - Acquiring diamonds.

There are 9 normal gems and one called Black Diamond which creates the strongest equipment and requires all other gems. Gems are diamond ore - rare, which means that they generate in place of a diamond ore. 

Gem ores will drop gems in 3 forms: tiny, normal or whole, creating a spectacular fountain of gems as the ore block is mined.

Mod is heavily inspired and uses in some degree textures from mod "Biomes 'O Plenty".
