// Well that requires config - mixin logic :v
// - make it override diamond gen on config_file bool
// - disable gen on config_file bool
// - make it override diamond recipes on config_file bool
// - disable recipes on config_file bool

- config option to change drops.
- config option to change gen.

- make nether ore worst then diamond but better than iron switch-ro

- test it again ! (there might be a bug with different texture being loaded somewhere before important renders 
like chunk, water, sky - weird rotation bug, wrong texture render bug )

- lower gem ore drop chances. 
- clear project off blocks rendering.
- mod might be overwriting wrong ore_gen decorator when using cave "uberhaul".
